ShapeOkoPowerBus
================

EAGLE project for laying out a small power distribution bus for a ShapeOko CNC mill.

I'm at the noob/beginner stage in electronics and PCB design. I am sick of wires everywhere with the CNC mill I built and decided to build a power distribution bus on a board to minimize all the wires running between the components I plan to put in an enclosure. Use at your own risk - I make no representations that I am doing this correctly - in fact I have problably screwed something up.
